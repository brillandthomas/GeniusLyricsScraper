# Genius Lyrics Scraper
Scrape song lyrics from https://genius.com

First you need to create an API on https://genius.com/api-clients.
You have to replace the GENIUS_API_TOKEN variable in token.py by your own token.
You can now run the lyrics_scraper.py after entering the artist name and the number of songs you want to scrape.
